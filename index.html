<p>In 2017 I have enrolled into High School full of enthusiasm and excitment, thinking that I will study stuff that I like and makes me happy.
As I have been studying, I started to find out that it is not the kind of stuff that brings me joy. It is actually games!</p>
<p>After graduation, I started to look for any entry level jobs in the videogame industry.</p>

<p>I have got an oportunity to beta test a videogame called Rustler as the devs have been giving out the beta keys for people willing to test the game for free and file a report for it afterwards. I have spent about 2 weeks in the game, which was quite a parody for an old GTA style of game set in the medieval era and full of pop culture references. I have liked it.</p>

<p>After some time, a small dev studio posted a question if any of the people would be willing to test an alpha demo of their game before releasing it as an full demo.</p>
<p>At the start of the alpha test, I had some technical issues as the game was not willing to start and kept crashing, but after some patches I have managed to make it work and swept thru the small, 2 hours long technical demo of the game, which featured the first hours of the nuclear powerplant accident.</p>
